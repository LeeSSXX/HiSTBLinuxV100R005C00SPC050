<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Distribution installers, cloud instantiation, image builds for particular devices, or any other way to deploy an operating system put its desired network configuration into YAML configuration file(s). During early boot, the netplan “network renderer” runs which reads <code>/{lib,etc,run}/netplan/*.yaml</code> and writes configuration to <code>/run</code> to hand off control of devices to the specified networking daemon.</p>
<ul>
<li>Configured devices get handled by systemd-networkd by default, unless explicitly marked as managed by a specific renderer (NetworkManager)</li>
<li>Devices not covered by the network config do not get touched at all.</li>
<li>Usable in initramfs (few dependencies and fast)</li>
<li>No persistent generated config, only original YAML config</li>
<li>Parser supports multiple config files to allow applications like libvirt or lxd to package up expected network config (<code>virbr0</code>, <code>lxdbr0</code>), or to change the global default policy to use NetworkManager for everything.</li>
<li>Retains the flexibility to change backends/policy later or adjust to removing NetworkManager, as generated configuration is ephemeral.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-structure">General structure</h2>
<p>netplan’s configuration files use the <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/current.html">YAML</a> format. All <code>/{lib,etc,run}/netplan/*.yaml</code> are considered. Lexicographically later files (regardless of in which directory they are) amend (new mapping keys) or override (same mapping keys) previous ones. A file in <code>/run/netplan</code> completely shadows a file with same name in <code>/etc/netplan</code>, and a file in either of those directories shadows a file with the same name in <code>/lib/netplan</code>.</p>
<p>The top-level node in a netplan configuration file is a <code>network:</code> mapping that contains <code>version: 2</code> (the YAML currently being used by curtin, MaaS, etc. is version 1), and then device definitions grouped by their type, such as <code>ethernets:</code>, <code>modems:</code>, <code>wifis:</code>, or <code>bridges:</code>. These are the types that our renderer can understand and are supported by our backends.</p>
<p>Each type block contains device definitions as a map where the keys (called “configuration IDs”) are defined as below.</p>
<h2 id="device-configuration-ids">Device configuration IDs</h2>
<p>The key names below the per-device-type definition maps (like <code>ethernets:</code>) are called “ID”s. They must be unique throughout the entire set of configuration files. Their primary purpose is to serve as anchor names for composite devices, for example to enumerate the members of a bridge that is currently being defined.</p>
<p>If an interface is defined with an ID in a configuration file; it will be brought up by the applicable renderer. To not have netplan touch an interface at all, it should be completely omitted from the netplan configuration files.</p>
<p>There are two physically/structurally different classes of device definitions, and the ID field has a different interpretation for each:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Physical devices</dt>
<dd><p>(Examples: ethernet, modem, wifi) These can dynamically come and go between reboots and even during runtime (hotplugging). In the generic case, they can be selected by <code>match:</code> rules on desired properties, such as name/name pattern, MAC address, driver, or device paths. In general these will match any number of devices (unless they refer to properties which are unique such as the full path or MAC address), so without further knowledge about the hardware these will always be considered as a group.</p>
<p>It is valid to specify no match rules at all, in which case the ID field is simply the interface name to be matched. This is mostly useful if you want to keep simple cases simple, and it’s how network device configuration has been done for a long time.</p>
<p>If there are <code>match</code>: rules, then the ID field is a purely opaque name which is only being used for references from definitions of compound devices in the config.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Virtual devices</dt>
<dd><p>(Examples: veth, bridge, bond) These are fully under the control of the config file(s) and the network stack. I. e. these devices are being created instead of matched. Thus <code>match:</code> and <code>set-name:</code> are not applicable for these, and the ID field is the name of the created virtual device.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="common-properties-for-physical-device-types">Common properties for physical device types</h2>
<dl>
<dt><code>match</code> (mapping)</dt>
<dd><p>This selects a subset of available physical devices by various hardware properties. The following configuration will then apply to all matching devices, as soon as they appear. <em>All</em> specified properties must match.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>name</code> (scalar)</dt>
<dd>Current interface name. Globs are supported, and the primary use case for matching on names, as selecting one fixed name can be more easily achieved with having no <code>match:</code> at all and just using the ID (see above). Note that currently only networkd supports globbing, NetworkManager does not.
</dd>
<dt><code>macaddress</code> (scalar)</dt>
<dd>Device’s MAC address in the form “XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX”. Globs are not allowed.
</dd>
<dt><code>driver</code> (scalar)</dt>
<dd>Kernel driver name, corresponding to the <code>DRIVER</code> udev property. Globs are supported. Matching on driver is <em>only</em> supported with networkd.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>all cards on second PCI bus:</p>
<pre><code> match:
   name: enp2*</code></pre></li>
<li><p>fixed MAC address:</p>
<pre><code> match:
   macaddress: 11:22:33:AA:BB:FF</code></pre></li>
<li><p>first card of driver <code>ixgbe</code>:</p>
<pre><code> match:
   driver: ixgbe
   name: en*s0</code></pre></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><code>set-name</code> (scalar)</dt>
<dd><p>When matching on unique properties such as path or MAC, or with additional assumptions such as “there will only ever be one wifi device”, match rules can be written so that they only match one device. Then this property can be used to give that device a more specific/desirable/nicer name than the default from udev’s ifnames. Any additional device that satisfies the match rules will then fail to get renamed and keep the original kernel name (and dmesg will show an error).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>wakeonlan</code> (bool)</dt>
<dd><p>Enable wake on LAN. Off by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>emit-lldp</code> (bool)</dt>
<dd><p>(networkd backend only) Whether to emit LLDP packets. Off by default.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="common-properties-for-all-device-types">Common properties for all device types</h2>
<dl>
<dt><code>renderer</code> (scalar)</dt>
<dd><p>Use the given networking backend for this definition. Currently supported are <code>networkd</code> and <code>NetworkManager</code>. This property can be specified globally in <code>networks:</code>, for a device type (in e. g. <code>ethernets:</code>) or for a particular device definition. Default is <code>networkd</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>renderer</code> property has one additional acceptable value for vlan objects (i. e. defined in <code>vlans:</code>): <code>sriov</code>. If a vlan is defined with the <code>sriov</code> renderer for an SR-IOV Virtual Function interface, this causes netplan to set up a hardware VLAN filter for it. There can be only one defined per VF.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>dhcp4</code> (bool)</dt>
<dd><p>Enable DHCP for IPv4. Off by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>dhcp6</code> (bool)</dt>
<dd><p>Enable DHCP for IPv6. Off by default. This covers both stateless DHCP - where the DHCP server supplies information like DNS nameservers but not the IP address - and stateful DHCP, where the server provides both the address and the other information.</p>
<p>If you are in an IPv6-only environment with completely stateless autoconfiguration (SLAAC with RDNSS), this option can be set to cause the interface to be brought up. (Setting accept-ra alone is not sufficient.) Autoconfiguration will still honour the contents of the router advertisement and only use DHCP if requested in the RA.</p>
<p>Note that <strong><code>rdnssd</code></strong>(8) is required to use RDNSS with networkd. No extra software is required for NetworkManager.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ipv6-mtu</code> (scalar)</dt>
<dd><p>Set the IPv6 MTU (only supported with <code>networkd</code> backend). Note that needing to set this is an unusual requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Requires feature: ipv6-mtu</strong></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ipv6-privacy</code> (bool)</dt>
<dd><p>Enable IPv6 Privacy Extensions (RFC 4941) for the specified interface, and prefer temporary addresses. Defaults to false - no privacy extensions. There is currently no way to have a private address but prefer the public address.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>link-local</code> (sequence of scalars)</dt>
<dd><p>Configure the link-local addresses to bring up. Valid options are ‘ipv4’ and ‘ipv6’, which respectively allow enabling IPv4 and IPv6 link local addressing. If this field is not defined, the default is to enable only IPv6 link-local addresses. If the field is defined but configured as an empty set, IPv6 link-local addresses are disabled as well as IPv4 link- local addresses.</p>
<p>This feature enables or disables link-local addresses for a protocol, but the actual implementation differs per backend. On networkd, this directly changes the behavior and may add an extra address on an interface. When using the NetworkManager backend, enabling link-local has no effect if the interface also has DHCP enabled.</p>
<p>Example to enable only IPv4 link-local: <code>link-local: [ ipv4 ]</code> Example to enable all link-local addresses: <code>link-local: [ ipv4, ipv6 ]</code> Example to disable all link-local addresses: <code>link-local: [ ]</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>critical</code> (bool)</dt>
<dd><p>(networkd backend only) Designate the connection as “critical to the system”, meaning that special care will be taken by systemd-networkd to not release the assigned IP when the daemon is restarted.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>dhcp-identifier</code> (scalar)</dt>
<dd><p>When set to ‘mac’; pass that setting over to systemd-networkd to use the device’s MAC address as a unique identifier rather than a RFC4361-compliant Client ID. This has no effect when NetworkManager is used as a renderer.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>dhcp4-overrides</code> (mapping)</dt>
<dd><p>(networkd backend only) Overrides default DHCP behavior; see the <code>DHCP Overrides</code> section below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>dhcp6-overrides</code> (mapping)</dt>
<dd><p>(networkd backend only) Overrides default DHCP behavior; see the <code>DHCP Overrides</code> section below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>accept-ra</code> (bool)</dt>
<dd><p>Accept Router Advertisement that would have the kernel configure IPv6 by itself. When enabled, accept Router Advertisements. When disabled, do not respond to Router Advertisements. If unset use the host kernel default setting.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>addresses</code> (sequence of scalars)</dt>
<dd><p>Add static addresses to the interface in addition to the ones received through DHCP or RA. Each sequence entry is in CIDR notation, i. e. of the form <code>addr/prefixlen</code>. <code>addr</code> is an IPv4 or IPv6 address as recognized by <strong><code>inet_pton</code></strong>(3) and <code>prefixlen</code> the number of bits of the subnet.</p>
<p>For virtual devices (bridges, bonds, vlan) if there is no address configured and DHCP is disabled, the interface may still be brought online, but will not be addressable from the network.</p>
<p>Example: <code>addresses: [192.168.14.2/24, "2001:1::1/64"]</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ipv6-address-generation</code> (scalar)</dt>
<dd><p>Configure method for creating the address for use with RFC4862 IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration. Possible values are <code>eui64</code> or <code>stable-privacy</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gateway4</code>, <code>gateway6</code> (scalar)</dt>
<dd><p>Set default gateway for IPv4/6, for manual address configuration. This requires setting <code>addresses</code> too. Gateway IPs must be in a form recognized by <strong><code>inet_pton</code></strong>(3).</p>
<p>Example for IPv4: <code>gateway4: 172.16.0.1</code> Example for IPv6: <code>gateway6: "2001:4::1"</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>nameservers</code> (mapping)</dt>
<dd><p>Set DNS servers and search domains, for manual address configuration. There are two supported fields: <code>addresses:</code> is a list of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses similar to <code>gateway*</code>, and <code>search:</code> is a list of search domains.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>ethernets:
  id0:
    [...]
    nameservers:
      search: [lab, home]
      addresses: [8.8.8.8, &quot;FEDC::1&quot;]</code></pre>
</dd>
<dt><code>macaddress</code> (scalar)</dt>
<dd><p>Set the device’s MAC address. The MAC address must be in the form “XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX”.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This will not work reliably for devices matched by name only and rendered by networkd, due to interactions with device renaming in udev. Match devices by MAC when setting MAC addresses.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>ethernets:
  id0:
    match:
      macaddress: 52:54:00:6b:3c:58
    [...]
    macaddress: 52:54:00:6b:3c:59</code></pre>
</dd>
<dt><code>mtu</code> (scalar)</dt>
<dd><p>Set the Maximum Transmission Unit for the interface. The default is 1500. Valid values depend on your network interface.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This will not work reliably for devices matched by name only and rendered by networkd, due to interactions with device renaming in udev. Match devices by MAC when setting MTU.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>optional</code> (bool)</dt>
<dd><p>An optional device is not required for booting. Normally, networkd will wait some time for device to become configured before proceeding with booting. However, if a device is marked as optional, networkd will not wait for it. This is <em>only</em> supported by networkd, and the default is false.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>ethernets:
  eth7:
    # this is plugged into a test network that is often
    # down - don&#39;t wait for it to come up during boot.
    dhcp4: true
    optional: true</code></pre>
</dd>
<dt><code>optional-addresses</code> (sequence of scalars)</dt>
<dd><p>Specify types of addresses that are not required for a device to be considered online. This changes the behavior of backends at boot time to avoid waiting for addresses that are marked optional, and thus consider the interface as “usable” sooner. This does not disable these addresses, which will be brought up anyway.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>ethernets:
  eth7:
    dhcp4: true
    dhcp6: true
    optional-addresses: [ ipv4-ll, dhcp6 ]</code></pre>
</dd>
<dt><code>routes</code> (mapping)</dt>
<dd><p>Configure static routing for the device; see the <code>Routing</code> section below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>routing-policy</code> (mapping)</dt>
<dd><p>Configure policy routing for the device; see the <code>Routing</code> section below.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="dhcp-overrides">DHCP Overrides</h2>
<p>Several DHCP behavior overrides are available. Most currently only have any effect when using the <code>networkd</code> backend, with the exception of <code>use-routes</code> and <code>route-metric</code>.</p>
<p>Overrides only have an effect if the corresponding <code>dhcp4</code> or <code>dhcp6</code> is set to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>If both <code>dhcp4</code> and <code>dhcp6</code> are <code>true</code>, the <code>networkd</code> backend requires that <code>dhcp4-overrides</code> and <code>dhcp6-overrides</code> contain the same keys and values. If the values do not match, an error will be shown and the network configuration will not be applied.</p>
<p>When using the NetworkManager backend, different values may be specified for <code>dhcp4-overrides</code> and <code>dhcp6-overrides</code>, and will be applied to the DHCP client processes as specified in the netplan YAML.</p>
<p>: The <code>dhcp4-overrides</code> and <code>dhcp6-overrides</code> mappings override the default DHCP behavior.</p>
<pre><code> ``use-dns`` (bool)
 :    Default: ``true``. When ``true``, the DNS servers received from the
      DHCP server will be used and take precedence over any statically
      configured ones. Currently only has an effect on the ``networkd``
      backend.

 ``use-ntp`` (bool)
 :    Default: ``true``. When ``true``, the NTP servers received from the
      DHCP server will be used by systemd-timesyncd and take precedence
      over any statically configured ones. Currently only has an effect on
      the ``networkd`` backend.

 ``send-hostname`` (bool)
 :    Default: ``true``. When ``true``, the machine&#39;s hostname will be sent
      to the DHCP server. Currently only has an effect on the ``networkd``
      backend.

 ``use-hostname`` (bool)
 :    Default: ``true``. When ``true``, the hostname received from the DHCP
      server will be set as the transient hostname of the system. Currently
      only has an effect on the ``networkd`` backend.

 ``use-mtu`` (bool)
 :    Default: ``true``. When ``true``, the MTU received from the DHCP
      server will be set as the MTU of the network interface. When ``false``,
      the MTU advertised by the DHCP server will be ignored. Currently only
      has an effect on the ``networkd`` backend.

 ``hostname`` (scalar)
 :    Use this value for the hostname which is sent to the DHCP server,
      instead of machine&#39;s hostname. Currently only has an effect on the
      ``networkd`` backend.

 ``use-routes`` (bool)
 :    Default: ``true``. When ``true``, the routes received from the DHCP
      server will be installed in the routing table normally. When set to
      ``false``, routes from the DHCP server will be ignored: in this case,
      the user is responsible for adding static routes if necessary for
      correct network operation. This allows users to avoid installing a
      default gateway for interfaces configured via DHCP. Available for
      both the ``networkd`` and ``NetworkManager`` backends.

 ``route-metric`` (scalar)
 :    Use this value for default metric for automatically-added routes.
      Use this to prioritize routes for devices by setting a higher metric
      on a preferred interface. Available for both the ``networkd`` and
      ``NetworkManager`` backends.

 ``use-domains`` (scalar)
 :    Takes a boolean, or the special value &quot;route&quot;. When true, the domain 
      name received from the DHCP server will be used as DNS search domain
      over this link, similar to the effect of the Domains= setting. If set
      to &quot;route&quot;, the domain name received from the DHCP server will be 
      used for routing DNS queries only, but not for searching, similar to
      the effect of the Domains= setting when the argument is prefixed with
      &quot;~&quot;.

      **Requires feature: dhcp-use-domains**</code></pre>
<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>
