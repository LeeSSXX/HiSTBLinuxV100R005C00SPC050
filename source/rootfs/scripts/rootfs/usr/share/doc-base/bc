Title: The GNU BC arbitrary precision calculator
Author: Philip A. Nelson
Abstract: bc is a language that supports arbitrary precision numbers
 with interactive execution of statements. There are some similarities
 in the syntax to the C programming language. A standard math library is
 available by command line option. If requested, the math library is
 defined before processing any files. bc starts by processing code from
 all the files listed on the command line in the order listed. After all
 files have been processed, bc reads from the standard input. All code
 is executed as it is read. (If a file contains a command to halt the
 processor, bc will never read from the standard input.)
